# Signal Processing and Visualization

This project demonstrates various signal processing techniques and visualizations using Python. It includes generating and plotting analog and digital signals, creating sine waves, and reconstructing signals from the frequency domain.

## Files

- `a.py`: Generates and plots analog and digital signals.
- `b.py`: Generates and plots a sine wave with user-defined parameters.
- `c.py`: Converts a signal from the frequency domain back to the time domain and plots the reconstructed signal.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/7odaHany/signal-processing-visualization.git
    cd signal-processing-visualization
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

1. Run `a.py` to generate and plot analog and digital signals:
    ```sh
    python a.py
    ```

2. Run `b.py` to generate and plot a sine wave:
    ```sh
    python b.py
    ```

3. Run `c.py` to reconstruct a signal from the frequency domain and plot it:
    ```sh
    python c.py
    ```
